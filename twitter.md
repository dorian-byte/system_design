Scaling Requirements — Capacity Estimation
Let’s say, we have —

No of users per day ( DAU ) : 50 Million

No of tweets per day : 50 Million

Tweet size ( 140 characters tweet) : 280 Bytes + 20 bytes for metadata of each tweet = Total 300 bytes

Storage Estimate —

50 Million * 300 bytes = 15 GB per day

For next 5 years —

15 GB * 365 * 5 = 28 TB

Note : For the sake of simplicity, I have done small scale simulation.
